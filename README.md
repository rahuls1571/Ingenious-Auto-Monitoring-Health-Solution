# Ingenious-Auto-Monitoring-Health-Solution
An Android Application Created to Monitoring Patient Health using Arduino, Sensors, Firebase and Android Studio. 

•	Real-time checking patient Health using Firebase.

•	Patient Health Parameter Heartbeat, Drip level, Thermometer, Room Temperature, ECG Sensor.

# Introduction : 

  Healthcare is given the extreme importance now a days by each country with the coming of the  corona virus So an IoT based health monitoring system is the best solution for     such an pandemic situation.

  An IOT based “Ingenious auto-monitoring health solution” is design, is not only a final year project but it is an idea that comes to my mind after visiting hospitals and    
  having discussion with doctor several months of the covid19 start. Here, we saw that important heartbeat, oxygen and contact less temperature sensor are the necessary 
  parameter of the patient in a pandemic situation or a normal situation.

  And also found some other problem after my friend grandmother death, we found some drip level monitoring problem and Also found ECG monitoring problem, the small-town hospital 
  doesn't have an ECG monitoring system so people have to go far away for ECG monitoring So it is very costly and time consuming So we add this problem into own project then we 
  turn all the problem idea into a prototype. In this project we are trying to solve all the necessary problem after discussion with a doctor.

  That's why we are making a Ingenious auto-monitoring health solution which is a great tool that can help us in saving human lives and it will decrease the chances of patient 
  hazards. In this health monitoring system, we can use various kind of sensors especially “drip level sensor which is designed by Rahul Suthar” that continuously provides data 
  of the patient. It uses various transmitters and receivers which helps in transferring data to an android application (I.A.M Health Solution) which is designed by own term 
  that is embedded with hardware. this system sends an indication just before time which helps hospital staff to watch patients on time.

# SOLUTION OF THESE PROBLEMS THAT SOLVED BY OUR PROTOTYPE :

This is a very basic problem which occurs in every hospital in day to day life generally in accident cases. the problem was discussed with Prof. K. Punithalakshmi Head of department (JIET Nursing) and also with the many doctors of different hospitals of different locations. From January,2020 we are going to the local hospital and discuss with different doctors and work on it and try to solve this problem statement.

•	Patient Monitoring Sensor :  A device that detects Different necessary parameters of health monitoring system like Heart Beat, ECG etc. and then send to Micro Controller.
 
•	Micro Controller : Here, A micro-controller is used for controlling sensor data like set the threshold value, calculate the temperature etc and then send all the data to wireless communication for future process.

•	Wireless Communication : Here, wifi module receives data form micro-controller and then it send to Server. 

•	Server : Here, we store the sensor data and then pass to android application. 

•	Android Application : In this Application, All the data are show in digital as well as in Analog form(In Graphical form) in real time and also send notification when sensor values below then threshold value.

To overcome this critical situation, An IOT “Ingenious auto monitoring health solution system” was developed by own term. The system monitored all the necessary parameters of health monitoring like Temperature, Heart beat , ECG, Drip level and Thermometer (Body temperature) using sensor. When drip level or any sensor value below then a threshold value then it send notification to authorized person smart phone whether the application is on or off and Data are show real time data in two form Digital as well as in Analog form which is very important to doctor to diagnose the disease and the state of health of the patient[4].

The system is simple and Power efficient it only required 3.3v.
Using this device reducing bridges gap between doctor and patients.
When fluid level is low, it alerts the observer through the mobile phone at the control room indicates the room number and further bed number of the patient for quick recovery. Hospitals use simple electrolyte bottles with no indication, it may create a problem to the patient because the reverse flow of blood will start, blood starts to flow from body towards bottle.
If such a monitoring system is built, it will decrease the chances of patients' hazards and increase the accuracy of health care in hospitals.
In hospitals ICU, CCU, NICU, OPD, OT, most of all departments of the hospital required such kind of automatic monitoring and indication system. Also healthcare industries will be one of the users. Such monitoring systems can be useful in small, medium, and large sizes of hospitals and also useful during home care/ covid-19 situation.
So my term design a ready to made portable cover system for such bottles. Ready-made wearable sensors on sides of the bottles can detect the level of fluid inside bottles [4]. Such data can also be sent to the nurse and doctor's mobile and they can monitor the fluid level and also monitor fluid condition and other parameters.
These systems track and sense the signals in real-time and further send to the desired person be it a doctor or family member, etc., for immediate assistance. This kind of assistance is now possible, all thanks to the enhancements in the field of communication, specifically Internet[2].
Hospital staff, the constant need to manually monitor the level of bottles is avoided. This high advantage to the patients especially during night times. This system also avoids the fatal risk of air bubbles entering the patient's bloodstream, which is a serious threat as air  bubbles can cause immediate death. Such a device will create assurity of non-harm condition to patients and also helpful to the monitoring of data and such data can be stored and will be useful in future. So we are designing this IOT based embedded system regarding patient's life hazards and help in saving humankind.
